# LvGridGenerator

## General Idea###

- Responsible to convert an Osm-Graph into a galvanical connected LV-Grid 
- LV-Grid should be build from standard asset types at the  right rated voltages
- By subDistrictCoordinator created loads for each house in OSM the loads will be connected electrically connected via a line

-> Outcome###  Grid per secondary substation region

## Functionality

### Take existing substation or create substation and define voltage leve

### Take raw street graph with loads and build grid graph

### Build GridContainer for grid of substation
